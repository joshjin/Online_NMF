To use this software, it is necessary to first install MATLAB Tensor Toolbox by Brett W. Bader and Tamara G. Kolda, available at http://csmr.ca.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/.  The latest version that was tested with this software is Version 2.4, March 2010. Refer to the help manual of the toolbox for installation and basic usage.

Please take a look at the description in 'ncp.m' and try to execute examples to learn how to use this software. Please send bug reports, comments, or questions to Jingu Kim (jingu.kim@gmail.com).
